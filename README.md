## Overview

This app provides a fast, offline-friendly checkout experience with inventory sync to Firebase. It uses a provider-based state management approach and clean separation between UI and services (Firebase, printing, local DB), making it easy to extend and test.

## Key features

- Fast sales screen with barcode search and quick-add
- Persistent transactions and inventory in Firestore
- Role-based authentication and basic reporting
- Receipt printing via supported plugins
- Offline-first behavior for core sales operations

## Quick start (Windows)

1. Open PowerShell at the repo root:
   `C:\FlutterDev\PROJECTS\pos`
2. Ensure your environment is ready:
   ```powershell
   flutter doctor
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   flutter pub get
   ```
4. Start an Android emulator or connect a device.
5. Ensure Firebase is configured (see below) or use the bundled `app/google-services.json` for a debug project.
6. Run the app:
   ```powershell
   flutter run -d <device-id>
   ```

Tip: omit `-d <device-id>` to use the default device.

## Firebase setup

1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Register Android and/or iOS apps and download the platform files (`google-services.json` / `GoogleService-Info.plist`). Place them in the appropriate platform directories (`app/` for Android).
3. The project includes `lib/firebase_options.dart` (generated by `flutterfire configure`). To regenerate:
   ```powershell
   dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
   flutterfire configure
   ```
4. Enable Authentication and Firestore for development. Use permissive rules while iterating, then tighten rules before production.

---

## Development & common tasks

- Run tests: `flutter test`
- Format: `flutter format .`
- Static analysis: `flutter analyze`
- Clean and restore: `flutter clean` then `flutter pub get`

---

## Building & release

- Debug: `flutter run`
- APK (debug): `flutter build apk --debug`
- APK (release): `flutter build apk --release`
- App Bundle: `flutter build appbundle`
- iOS release (macOS): `flutter build ios --release`

Before publishing, be sure to:

- Replace any demo Firebase configuration with production credentials
- Update `version` and `buildNumber` in `pubspec.yaml` and native configs
- Test integrations (printing/payment) on real devices

---

## Project structure (important folders)

- `lib/main.dart` — App entry and bootstrap
- `lib/constants/` — Global constants
- `lib/models/` — Domain models (Product, Sale, User)
- `lib/providers/` — State management
- `lib/screens/` — UI pages and navigation
- `lib/services/` — Firebase, printing, payment, local DB
- `lib/theme/` — Theme & styling
- `lib/widgets/` — Reusable UI components

This layout keeps business logic testable and UI simple.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Missing or outdated `firebase_options.dart`: run `flutterfire configure` to regenerate.
- Android Google services errors: confirm `app/google-services.json` matches the Android package id.
- Plugin/native build failures: try `flutter clean` → `flutter pub get`, and ensure SDK/toolchain requirements are installed.
- Windows plugin build issues: verify MSVC and Android SDK are configured.
